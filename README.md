# BHARTH-INTERNSHIP
This repository contains the tasks I completed during my Machine Learning internship with Bharat Intern. Throughout the internship, I worked on various projects and models to enhance my skills in the field of Machine Learning.
Tasks Completed:
Task 1: [House Price Prediction]
Task 2: [Wine Quality Prediction]
Task 3: [Iris classification]
Each task focused on different aspects of Machine Learning, allowing me to gain hands-on experience and apply various algorithms and techniques.
Repository Contents:
[Task 1 :House Price Prediction ]: Contains the code, datasets, and any addition readme related to Task 1.
[Task 2 :Wine Quality Prediction]: Contains the code, datasets, and any additional readme related to Task 2.
[Task 3 :Iris classification]: Contains the code, datasets, and any additional readme related to Task 3.
By completing these tasks, I have gained valuable knowledge and practical skills in Machine Learning, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
