Iris flower classification is a well-known and popular machine learning project.
The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers: Versicolor, Setosa, and Virginica.
The aim of iris flower classification is to predict the species of a flower based on its specific features, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
Iris classification is a multi-class classification problem, as it involves predicting one of three possible classes.
The iris dataset is often used as a case study to introduce beginners to machine learning concepts and techniques.
By completing the iris classification project, you can gain hands-on experience in supervised learning and classification algorithms
